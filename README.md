**`On my way to become a data scientist!`**

I'm chemical engineer with a postgraduate degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in progress. I'm in love with coding and try to use it all the time to automate and make my life more efficient and also to increase my skills.

### 📺 Projects on going

🖥️ RPA for automation of register process:
         *Description: Basically, starting with the input of the user of which supplier will be registered, the RPA needs to read a register form on excel, treat the data that is being received and what
         the system can or cannot accept for each input and click through the company's system to enter the information and register the supplier. Tools used: Python and VS Code*

🖥️ App of price analysis:
          *Description: The user will download an excel file of the system with all the prices offered by the suppliers and they will be able to input this file into a PowerApps and this app will be 
          responsible for preparing an entire price analysis with suggestions. Tools used: PowerApps and Power Automation*

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started learning about code in college as a chemical engineering student and have done some nice projects like a pacman all built with C++. My passion started at that moment but I continued my
graduation thinking repeatedly about changing to Computer engineer. For 5 years I studied some python, javascript, html and c++. In 2022, I decided that I needed to change my choices and started focusing
on studying Power BI, and some tools that would help me with moving to a different area and working with data analysis. This year I started my postgraduation in Data Science and Artificial intelligence.
